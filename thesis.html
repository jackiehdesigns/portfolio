                    <p>Walking around Dutch cities, one would commonly experience a sharp transition from the historic inner city and the outer neighbouring areas. Often the transition is exacerbated by the ‘singel’, the former moats that enclose the old city cores. This distinction is due to the fortresses and extensive fortifications that were built around Dutch towns between the 14th and 17th century. </p>
                    <p>By the end of the 18th century, the changes in military strategy with construction of the defense lines and frontier cities meant the fortifications of most cities were no longer of use. In turn, the fortifications became serious obstacles to urban development which forced cities to built within its cramped defences. It was the passing of the Vestingwet (Fortress Law) in 1874 which finally allowed the dismantling of fortifications and urban expansion beyond. </p>
                    <p>The passing of the Vestingwet saw unprecedented simultaneous and large-scale urban development across many Dutch towns. Coupled with the involvement of the state and regulations the Woningwet (Housing Act)of 1901, it has resulted in uniformity in urban planning and architecture, visible even today. This thesis aims to unpack the urban transformation of Dutch towns after this crucial milestone through 3 case studies: Groningen, Deventer, and ‘s-Hertogenbosch. It will also address the role of F.W. van Gendt, the state-appointed architect for dismantling and expansion plans, as well as various municipal architects and stakeholders  that influenced urban development across the Netherlands late 19th century  to 20th century. Ultimately, it will demonstrate the significance of how the Vestingwet  has shaped Dutch cities. </p>
