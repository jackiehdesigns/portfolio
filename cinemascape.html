                <div id="introtext">
                    <p>In a world increasingly under pressure due to housing shortages, urbanization, and climate change, the Friche Josaphat stands as the last green in town in the midst of metropolitan Brussels. However, urban green spaces are usually experienced by distracted urban audiences, preoccupied by day-to-day issues of bills, work, and children, or absorbed in the over-stimulating digital worlds within their smartphone screens. Therefore, it is important to rethink contemporary approaches to nature and urban green space. </p>
                    <p>The design of my building intertwines memorable and immersive experiences with nature in a cinema and housing tower to allow residents and visitors to discover the special and sublime in our everyday lives. By provoking those who experience them into re-encountering their relationship with the natural world, this can lead to new engagement and imaginations, even empowering them to make changes. In doing so, urban green spaces become not just environmentally resilient against the increasing forces of climate change, but also resilient from demolition to meet demands in ever-growing cities.</p>

                <div class="gallery2">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">My design is rooted in my research into land art projects, which provide great insight into exaggerated constructions of nature and how sequential journeys and vantage points influence their designs. For example, James Turrell’s Celestial Vault serves as a magnifying glass that momentarily confronts and re-centers our ability to see and appreciate the sky. The artificial crater, forming the edge of the enclosure that frames the view of the sky, is an exaggerated version of the dune formations in the surrounding natural landscape of Kijkduin in Den Haag. Here, tension is created between the real and unreal, between belonging and being out-of-place, between intimate and immense, and between nature and artifice. In the selection of projects, there is always a relative unobtrusiveness or secrecy from the outside (nestled in the site’s gentle topography, a shallow earthen mound seamlessly merged with the polder landscape, an invisible bridge sunken into the slopes and water). This contrasts with the assertive and outspoken forms experienced from close-up and within. With their monolithic forms, they seem to have emerged from the ground, inducing a sense of primitive timelessness. This focus on sequence would also guide my research into understanding how to design my approach and entry to the site.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I also looked into drawings and projects of stage set designer/ architect Hans Dieter Schaal who explores in almost endless experimental drawings, different surreal pathways surrounded by a synthesis of natural settings and man-made structures. I created my own drawings that speculate on spatial experiences and journeys for my project. They were done instinctively, with elements recognizable of the Friche occasionally interjected, such as the train tracks and sloped terrain surrounding the edges of the site. They tie in architectural themes I have been addressing such as augmented nature and hyper-nature, immersive experiences, emphasis on journey to create a theatrical staging of spaces and allowed me to speculate on the relationship between my proposed building and the Friche. These drawings also served as an opportunity to guide my design and formulate possible spatial arrangement of programs and circulation.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Masterplan Proposal</h3> <p><em>in collaboration with Jaron Smit & Jacky Lai</em></p> 
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Situated on the abandoned marshalling yard, the Friche Josaphat in the northeast Schaerbeek of Brussels has long been an isolated land surrounded by fences and tall trees. The segregation has created a santuary for rare wildlife and flora to thrive, leading to an ecological system with high biodiversity. In 2019, the government’s master plan for densifying this empty land was suspended due to the reconsideration of the ecological values and the neighbourhoods’ concerns. Consequently, several activists’ organisations proposed the “Plan B Josaphat Manifesto” which suggested displacing all the urban constructions to east side of the Friche, leaving the west side untouched and preserved for nature. To seek for an urban alternative to respond to the housing demand, our group decided to adapt the basic principle of the “Plan B” and began to draft a new masterplan which correlates more to the unique landscape and qualities of the Friche.</p>

                <img src="images/cinemascape_016.jpg" alt="" title="" width="55%" style="margin-bottom: 100px; float: left;margin-left: 5%; margin-top: 30px;">
                <h3>The Design Proposal</h3>
                <h4 style="text-align: justify;">The overarching design idea involved was that “the project should distill and augment the sense of  nature and unique qualities of La Friche.” How can Nature “be exaggerated, juxtaposed, or even distorted in architecture” and how can the intrinsic qualities of the Friche be reinforced and amplified?</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">This exaggerating of nature in the housing design is perhaps best expressed in the design of the principal façade. Facing south-west directly towards the Friche, the grandeur of the view is emphasized in the apartment units with 1.5 story high living rooms. To provide views, the façade is predominantly glazed to also allow maximum daylight and solar heat gains in the winter. It is also composed of a combination of balconies and winter gardens that have a generous 2.2m depth. They are lined with planters that are flush with the terrace floor, and collectively form a green ‘veil’ between the Friche and the building. </p>

                        <img src="images/cinemascape_spread4.png" alt="" title="" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                    </a>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Multiple apartment units offers both a winter garden and balcony, providing juxtaposing climatic conditions and varying qualities of stay and activities for different seasons. In the winter, the glazed sliding elements of the winter garden can be closed, trapping the warm air from the solar gain of the low-angle sun to create a cosy environment. It also serves as an insulating buffer to the rest of the apartment. In contrast, the adjacent terrace area faces the full forces of the south-west winds. The grey granite tile flooring provides thermal mass to help absorb, store, and release heat. This granite flooring partially extends indoor into the living room before it steps down into the parquet flooring. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the warmer months, the glass sliding doors can be opened and the terrace can be ‘expanded’ with the extension of the granite flooring indoors. This larger space allows for more flexibility in use, while also encouraging residents to open the façade regardless of sun or rain. To avoid glare and summertime over-heating, the wooden horizontal louvers for the balustrades also suspend partway down, and as a result, creates a blurring of the single and 1.5 storey levels of the façade from afar. The embedded planter also ‘sets back’ the terrace area, and excess water from gardening and a water mist system helps cooling on hot summer days. </p>
                    <h4>Here, Nature (in the form of sunlight, wind, water, temperature, seasons, flora, etc.) is augmented at a detail level. The elements are also juxtaposed and arranged as a sequence of sensations. </h4>
