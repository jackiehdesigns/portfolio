                <div id="introtext">
                    <p>The SSP Hall is the new event and exhibition venue at the DRU Industriepark. Formerly a factory for stainless steel products, it has been listed as a national heritage since 2002 and is to be reprogrammed into a ‘cultural factory’ along with the rest of the complex. Diepenbrock and Reigers Ulft (DRU) is an ironwork company since 1754 that was once a household name in the Netherlands and the biggest employer of the Achterhoek region. </p>
                    <p>For the design, the main intervention of the SSP Hall also forms the new main space: the Event Hall. The middle portion of the south facade is reassembled to stand 27m away, creating an extension for the Event Hall in a prominent location. The design brings together the new extension and the iconic blue-painted timber siding facade to form a green space that invites people to linger. </p>
                    <p>While the SSP Hall extends to embrace the street and row houses to the south, the north and east addresses the rest of the DRU Complex. The main entrance and foyer is situated on the opposite end to the Event Hall, bringing in visitors who arrive and park their cars in the north. From the foyer, visitors can split off left and right to the exhibition spaces which are arranged between the existing steel truss structure. The offices are concentrated in the corner of the former cupola furnace room, in proximity to the other business functions to the east.</p>
                    <p>The transformation creates  a range of informal social spaces both inside and around the perimeter, inviting chance encounters for visitors, residents, and employees alike.</p>

                        <p>The complexity of the new programmes of the SSP Hall is solved in a simple way by maintaining the existing pragmatic industrial layout and rigorous geometry. The majority of new proposed programmes are arranged along the length of the three-aisle hall, with the main entrance addressing the rest of the DRU complex. The four galleries are arranged symmetrically on both sides of the foyer, separated by a thin service volumes for the reception, art storage, and toilets. Above the entrance foyer is a floating mezzanine block for the gallery space office. At one end are additional office spaces and meeting rooms, while the other end of the hall houses the cafe/bar and ceramics workshop, which opens up to outdoor work space. The other half reveals the event hall as the main protagonist of the building. It aligns with the entrance lobby and protrudes from the south facade as a wood-clad extension with its own service block.

                        <p>The revitalised design meets a series of demanding technical challenges: the new required programmes exceeding the area of the existing, the varying climatic, acoustic, and lighting requirements, the minimization of the building’s environmental impact, while balancing the tension between preservation and renewal of the historic SSP Hall.</p>
                        <p>The pragmatic plan layout creates compact climate zones, easing the integration of ventilation and heating systems. They are centered around the 3 closed volumes for services, each serving their adjacent respective areas, including one isolated for the Event Hall extension. With high headroom, the HVAC units are situated above the service blocks, to avoid construction on the roof.</p>
                        <p>The mezzanine spaces utilise the existing steel structure, which are over-dimensioned due to their former use supporting a crane system for moving the molten steel during the SSP Hall’s former days of manufacturing. </p>

                            <p>In contrast to the existing industrial character of the SSP Hall, the event hall is lined with birch veneer and laminate wood flooring. The simple space of the hall with retractable spectator seating forms a pleasant setting for conferences, concerts, parties, and large-scale events.
                            </p>
                            <p>Glulam timber beams hold up the suspended ceiling, separated from the outer walls on three sides allowing for natural illumination from above. The skylights are pitched away from the perimeter, allowing for rainwater to flow towards the middle the roof and be collected in a rainwater tank for gardening and toilet flushing. On one length, glass sliding doors opens outdoors to a green gathering space and allows a view from outside of what is happening in the hall, while the other length accommodates a service block with the toilets, storage space, and utilities.
