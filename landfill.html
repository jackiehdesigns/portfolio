                    <p>The West Attica port area and Elefsina Gulf - located only a few kilometres from Athens - serve as an extended site of research. Now a major industrial town ridden with pollution, Elefsina is a far cry from its sacred history being part of the ancient Athenian polis. It accomodates port logistics, a military airport, petrol refineries, quarries, garbage landfills, and ship cemeteries. </p>
                    <p> The Fyli - Ano Liosia landfill is taken as a fascinating site to explore the definition of ‘ground’ and challenge the conventional notions between architecture and land(scape). The landfill experiences the build-up of ‘ground’ everyday, as household garbage along with soil cover are piled up everyday. At the same time, the garbage decomposes, leading to the ‘ground’ to sink, collapse, and harden. Areas for active landfill rotate around until the ‘ground’ reach maximum capacity and become closed to begin the landfill rehabilitation process
                    </p>
                    <p> This research evolved into a design for a National Center for Landfill Research. It includes a visitor center, offering a museum-like experience. In addition, it includes research facilites for monitoring, daily operations and scientific research, as well as for anthropology with landfill as a site for the archaeology of modern society. The design is realised through two key interventions: ‘Excavate’ - two ravines carved 60m deep into landfill area of the early 200s, and ‘Plant’ - a proposal for post-industrial relics installed at the future landfill extension.  </p>

                    <p>By cutting and excavating into the old landfill, it reveals the accumulation of waste like geological strata. Pathways reach the depths of the landfill, forcing us to come face to face to the staggering extent of reckless human consumption. Artefacts of Athen’s recent history may be discovered in the unearthing. The landfill serves as a time capsule - whether for cultural commentary or scientific study. The ‘cuts’ - extrapolated from the slashes of the military airport and logistics center on the Thriassion Plain - carve out two 120m long trenches in the Ano Liosia Landfill II, containing  landill of Athens from 2003-2006, including remnants of the 2004 Athens Olympics. </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">(below left) Visitors and staff (equipped in protective gear) can traverse through the depths of the landfill on metal catwalks. Steel wire mesh is layered behind the thick, tempered glass, forming a type of gabion wall for futher structural support.</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">(below right) Cross-section : Part museum experience, part monitoring & research centre, at its maximum, it reaches a  depth of 60 metres-over two decades of waste.</p>

                    <p>Elements can be planted as ‘seeds of permanence’ to make invisible qualities of the landscape and processes legible over time.

                    The weathering and changing ‘ground’ conveys the shifting unstable nature due to the simultaneous built-up and decomposition formed by the successive layers of trash. 
                        
                    Defunct silos and various other relics of Elesfina’s post-industrial sites will be the found objects to be planted in the future extension of the Fylis landfill. 
                        
                    Arranged equidistant in a grid, they can also serve as storage for part of the leachate collection or landfill gas extraction system. </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">(below left) As trash is piled up around the defunct silos and relics, wall openings transform from windows to doors. The rising and falling ground condition continuously reshapes the architectural conditions. </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">(below right) Cross-section : The re-purposed silos are functionable by storing leachate or landfill gases. Overtime, the invisible processes on a landfill (chemical erosion from decomposition, weathering from sun and rain) are rendered visible on these relics.</p>
